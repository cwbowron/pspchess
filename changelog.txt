FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT CALL ME IF YOU CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO
INSTALL THE PROGRAM.  SEARCH THE WEB ON PSP HOMEBREW.  READ THE

JUST CALL UP CHRIS AND ASK HIM. NO. NO. NO.
     
key changes:

pgn import - parser is not extremely robust but should work in most
cases
	
fixed compiler warnings

external pieces and set the pieces file to the png of your choice.
refer to pieces.png for the format.  each piece is 32x32.  must be
PNG.  If anyone makes some cool pieces, please share them with me and
other users.  You can email them to chess AT bowron.us.

options->music options->backgrnd music
	
RELEASE 0.28
	
castling support in wild5 and fischer random - redid all castling code

mp3 background music (slows down computer a little more than mod file)
--> switching back and forth and back between mp3 and mod is not working.
mp3->mod->mp3 and mod->mp3->mod may cause crash.  mod->mp3->mp3 is
fine. Bottom line:  if you want mp3 music, switch from mod->mp3 and do
not switch back without restarting pspChess.

export pgn option in options menu (exports to \PSP\GAME\PSPCHESS\EXPORT.PGN)

	you can have personality play each other by setting them up in

RELEASE 0.21
	
cleaned up evaluation code a bit - easier to understand what's going
on.  If anyone wants to write up another evalation function for a new
personality, feel free to do so and send me the code.  I would like to

outside of evaluate() please use different function names so that I
can drop it in without name conflicts)
